      <p class="two">  Support your local libraries! We have many fun programs, resources and much more. All resources are free. Come register for a library card. If you need support in school or need to do research, we have resources and databases you can search through to help you achieve what you want. You can research independently or you can set up a reference meeting to receive help from the library staff who are trained in finding research! <br>

						</br>Looking less on the side of research? We have plenty of fun fictional novels or recreational materials you can choose from as well. We also have plenty of fun and engaging programs that you can try out. Learn a new skill like crocheting or knitting, or come play board games or video games. We have it all. </p>
